# OpenAI Fine-tuner Examples

This directory contains examples demonstrating how to use the OpenAI Fine-tuner library.

## Demo Script

The [demo.py](demo.py) script shows a basic example of:

1. Creating a simple training dataset
2. Uploading it to OpenAI
3. Creating and running a fine-tuning experiment
4. Monitoring the experiment progress

### Usage

To run the demo:

1. Create a `.env` file in the project root with your OpenAI API key:
2. Run the script: `python demo.py`

This script will create a dataset, run a fine-tuning experiment, and print the latest checkpoint information.
